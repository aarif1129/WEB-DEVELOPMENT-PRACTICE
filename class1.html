        <i><figcaption>Cricket is played with a bat and ball and involves two competing sides (teams) of 11 players. The field is oval with a rectangular area in the middle, known as the pitch, that is 22 yards (20.12 metres) by 10 feet (3.04 metres) wide. Two sets of three sticks, called wickets, are set in the ground at each end of the pitch. Across the top of each wicket lie horizontal pieces called bails. The sides take turns at batting and bowling (pitching); each turn is called an “innings” (always plural). Sides have one or two innings each, depending on the prearranged duration of the match, the object being to score the most runs. The bowlers, delivering the ball with a straight arm, try to break (hit) the wicket with the ball so that the bails fall. This is one of several ways that the batsman is dismissed, or put out. A bowler delivers six balls at one wicket (thus completing an “over”), then a different player from his side bowls six balls to the opposite wicket. The batting side defends its wicket.</p></i></figcaption>

           <i> <p>Fort Youngsters’ opening batswomen Janhvi Kate’s unbeaten 185 (70 balls, 35x4, 4x6), Riya Chaudhari’s 111 not out (53 balls, 18x4) and Rajwadi CC opener Kshama Patekar’s unbeaten 161 (73 balls, 25x4, 4x6) stole the thunder on the opening day of the first Mumbai Cricket Association-organised Women’s Cricket League at Cross Maidan on Wednesday. Mandavi Muslims and Prabhu Jolly Young Cricketers respectively were at the receiving end of the brilliant batting by the trio.</p></i>
